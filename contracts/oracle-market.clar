;; ============================================
;; ORACLE MARKET - Decentralized Prediction Market
;; ============================================
;; A blockchain-based prediction market platform where users can stake STX
;; on various outcomes of future events. Markets are created by admins and
;; resolved by trusted oracles who verify real-world outcomes.
;; 
;; Key Features:
;; - Oracle-verified market resolution for trustworthy outcomes
;; - Multi-outcome prediction markets (2-10 outcomes per market)
;; - Dynamic odds calculation based on stake distribution
;; - Platform fee collection for sustainable operations
;; - Achievement NFT system to reward active predictors
;; - Soulbound achievement tokens (non-transferable)
